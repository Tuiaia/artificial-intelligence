quem ainda cai? . Conheça os casos com mais vítimas no país e saiba o que fazer para identificar uma possível fraude . Virou rotina. Quase toda semana, golpes financeiros ganham espaço no noticiário brasileiro. O último caso envolveu os jogadores brasileiros Gustavo Scarpa, Mayke Rocha Oliveira e Willian Gomes de Siqueira. Juntos, os atletas alegam ter perdido quase R$ 30 milhões em um suposto esquema fraudulento que usava criptomoedas como isca. O valor parece alto, mas é discreto perto das perdas registradas na história recente do País. Não há estimativas oficiais, mas um levantamento feito pelo InfoMoney mostra que, nos últimos cinco anos, pelo menos 23 empresas acusadas de serem pirâmides financeiras envolvendo o suposto investimento em criptoativos deixaram um rastro de prejuízo de cerca de R$ 40 bilhões no Brasil. O número estimado de vítimas é de quase 4 milhões. Só entre janeiro e setembro de 2022, a Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM) enviou 112 comunicações de indícios de crimes financeiros aos ministérios públicos estaduais e federais, segundo o último Relatório de Atividade Sancionadora, divulgado em dezembro. As pirâmides (de cripto e outros ativos) foram os tipos de delitos que mais apareceram. Em 2021, foram 215 e, em 2020, o pior ano da série, o total foi de 325. Além das comunicações, o órgão regulador do mercado de capitais também emitiu 12 stop orders para empresas nos primeiros três trimestres de 2022. Essas ordens são medidas cautelares que visam prevenir ou corrigir possíveis ofertas públicas irregulares. “O que a gente vê em análise histórica é que esses tipos de crimes financeiros envolvendo oferecimento de vantagens insustentáveis são antigos e, em comum, trabalham com algo que não é materialmente tangível, como os criptoativos”, disse o Procurador da República Thiago Bueno, integrante do Grupo de Crimes Cibernéticos do Ministério Público Federal (MPF). Na década de 1920, por exemplo, o italiano Charles Ponzi (precursor dos esquemas ponzi) prometia pagar juros de 50% em 45 dias ou de 100% em 90 dias em um negócio de cupons de selos postais. Na década de 1980, no Brasil, as Fazendas Reunidas Boi Gordo se valeram de promessas de ganhos financeiros em cima da criação e engorda de bois para atrair vítimas. As criptos são a bola da vez, segundo Bueno, por causa de algumas características desses ativos digitais, como imaterialidade, falta de conjunto de normas e práticas para negociação (como as do mercado financeiro), o fato de serem novas e ainda pouco compreendidas por parte da população, e o poder de suas valorizações estratosféricas. “Quando o valor do criptoativo está subindo, é o momento adequado para quem quer aplicar golpe poder ganhar fôlego”. Entre 2019 e 2023, período em que o Bitcoin (BTC) disparou e chamou atenção de investidores institucionais, o Brasil e o mundo foram inundados de fraudes associadas a ativos digitais. Um dos casos a ganhar destaque nacional foi a Unick Forex, uma fraude com criptomoedas que prometia de 1, 5% a 3% ao dia – é isso mesmo que você leu, ao dia. O esquema, criado no Vale dos Sinos (RS) por Leidimar Bernardo Lopes, colapsou em 2019. De acordo com a Polícia Federal, o golpe deixou um rastro de perdas de R$ 12 bilhões para milhares de pessoas. Outro caso que repercutiu no Brasil todo foi o Grupo Bitcoin Banco, uma fraude orquestrada em Curitiba (PR) por Claudio Oliveira, conhecido no Brasil como “Rei do Bitcoin”. Condenado por estelionato e crimes contra o sistema financeiro, Oliveira construiu um falso império cripto na capital paranaense, localizado em um dos prédios comerciais mais badalados da cidade. Assim como na Unick Forex, também havia promessa de ganho fixo no esquema. Pessoas chegaram a vender apartamentos para entrar no negócio. A estimativa é de que 7 mil indivíduos tenham sido prejudicados, em um rombo de R$ 1, 5 bilhão, segundo a PF.

Depois de estabelecerem a confiança, eles prometem um retorno garantido, e se aproveitam da ganância natural do ser humano”, disse ele. Segundo o especialista, vítimas normalmente alocam recursos nos investimentos suspeitos sem fazer a devida pesquisa, após recomendações de amigos, celebridades ou mesmo líderes religiosos. Glaidson dos Santos, conhecido como “Faraó do Bitcoin” e a mente por trás de um esquema com criptos que movimentou bilhões de reais, já foi pastor. Já Francisley Valdevino da Silva, conhecido como “Sheik das Criptomoedas”, era ligado à comunidade gospel brasileira. Na segunda-feira (20), o marceneiro Carlos Eduardo César, 34, contou ao InfoMoney que, após a indicação de um grande amigo, investiu na Xland, mesma empresa que deve R$ 30 milhões aos jogadores Mayke, Scarpa e William “Bigode”, e que é investigada pelo Ministério Público do Acre por suposta prática de crime contra a economia popular. A vítima entrou com um processo contra o negócio e está tentando recuperar R$ 120 mil. “Infelizmente como é algo muito novo, tem muito golpe, gente querendo enganar todo mundo. E acabou que eu caí nessa, e investi a maior parte do meu dinheiro”, comentou. “Eu vendi um bem para poder investir e conseguir respirar um pouco, mas acabei me enrolando mais ainda”. Macedo Junior, da UFSC, listou alguns sinais que permitem identificar um golpe financeiro. São eles:Ganhos garantidos; Altos retornos com baixo risco; Senso de urgência e medo; Falta de registro em órgãos reguladores; Informações secretas ou vagas sobre as estratégias de investimento; Pagamentos de comissões para atrair novos investidores; Ofertas de investimentos não solicitadas, feitas pelo WhatsApp, por exemplo; Criação de uma estratégia supostamente fácil de ganhar dinheiro; Exclusividade. Quanto é aceitável? No mercado de renda variável, principalmente no setor de criptomoedas, conhecido por suas oscilações extremas, nenhuma promessa de lucro fixo e garantido é aceitável, segundo Bruno Musa, sócio e consultor de investimentos da Acqua Vero. “Se alguém prometer qualquer rendimento fixo para você, duvide, porque essa pessoa provavelmente está mentindo. Como é possível conseguir garantir o retorno de um ativo que é extremamente volátil, e que você não sabe se pode subir 80% no dia ou cair 80% no outro? ”De acordo com Musa, muita gente no Brasil e no mundo acaba caindo em golpe financeiro por causa da falta de educação financeira. “Ninguém faz a lógica do raciocínio. Se alguém paga 5% ao mês, essa pessoa que está te remunerando precisa ganhar mais para ter o lucro dela. Ninguém vai te dar 5% ao mês como instituição filantrópica. Estude, pergunte e tire dúvidas. Vai dar trabalho, mas isso evita que você caia em uma cilada”, falou.'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3557,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681277499931,"user":{"displayName":"Tiago Santi","userId":"02979615434612127801"},"user_tz":240},"id":"emODbqf3x-mz","outputId":"b9725a2a-4f0b-46dc-c390-a46c773c4825"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length.
